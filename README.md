# Thinker Robot Engine Control

Engine control code

## Prerequisites

To use the code in this repo, your system must be set up for RP2040 C/C++ development. See [this blog post of mine](https://blog.smittytone.net/2021/02/02/program-raspberry-pi-pico-c-mac/) for setup details.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/smittytone/RP2040-FreeRTOS`.
1. Enter the repo: `cd RP2040-FreeRTOS`.
1. Install the submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
1. Optionally, edit `CMakeLists.txt` and `/<Application>/CMakeLists.txt` to rename the project.
1. Optionally, manually configure the build process: `cmake -S . -B build/`.
1. Optionally, manually build the app: `cmake --build build`.
1. Connect your device so it’s ready for file transfer.
1. Install the app: `./deploy.sh`.
    * Pass the app you wish to deplopy:
        * `./deploy.sh build/App-Template/TEMPLATE.uf2`.
        * `./deploy.sh build/App-Scheduling/SCHEDULING_DEMO.uf2`.
    * To trigger a build, include the `--build` or `-b` flag: `./deploy.sh -b`.

## Debug vs Release

You can switch between build types when you make the `cmake` call in step 5, above. A debug build is made explicit with:

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

For a release build, which among various optimisations omits UART debugging code, call:

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Follow both of these commands with the usual

```shell
cmake --build build
```


## The Apps

This repo includes a number of deployable apps. The project builds them all, sequentially. Exclude apps from the build process by commenting out their `add_subdirectory()` lines in the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`.

### App One: Template

This C app provides a simple flip-flop using an on-board LED and an LED wired between GPIO 20 and GND. The board LED flashes every 500ms under one task. When its state changes, a message containing its state is added to a FreeRTOS inter-task xQueue. A second task checks for an enqueued message: if one is present, it reads the message and sets the LED it controls — the GPIO LED — accordingly to the inverse of the board LED’s state.

The code demonstrates a basic FreeRTOS setup, but you can replace it entirely with your own code if you’re using this repo’s contents as a template for your own projects.

### App Two: Scheduling

This C++ app builds on the first by adding an MCP9808 temperature sensor and an HT16K33-based LED display. It is used in [this blog post](https://blog.smittytone.net/2022/03/04/further-fun-with-freertos-scheduling/).

### App Three: IRQs

This C++ app builds on the second by using the MCP9808 temperature sensor to trigger an interrupt. It is used in [this blog post](https://blog.smittytone.net/2022/03/20/fun-with-freertos-and-pi-pico-interrupts-semaphores-notifications/).

### App Four: Timers

This C++ app provides an introduction to FreeRTOS’ software timers. No extra hardware is required. It is used in [this blog post](https://blog.smittytone.net/2022/06/14/fun-with-freertos-and-the-pi-pico-timers/).

## IDEs

Workspace files are included for the Visual Studio Code and Xcode IDEs.

## Credits

This work was inspired by work done on [Twilio Microvisor FreeRTOS Demo code](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-microvisor-freertos), but the version of the `FreeRTOSConfig.h` file included here was derived from [work by @yunka2](https://github.com/yunkya2/pico-freertos-sample).

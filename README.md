# Thinker Robot Engine Control

Engine control code

## Prerequisites

To use the code in this repo, your system must be set up for RP2040 C/C++ development. See [this blog post of mine](https://blog.smittytone.net/2021/02/02/program-raspberry-pi-pico-c-mac/) for setup details.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/smittytone/RP2040-FreeRTOS`.
1. Enter the repo: `cd RP2040-FreeRTOS`.
1. Install the submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
1. Optionally, edit `CMakeLists.txt` and `/<Application>/CMakeLists.txt` to rename the project.
1. Optionally, manually configure the build process: `cmake -S . -B build/`.
1. Optionally, manually build the app: `cmake --build build`.
1. Connect your device so itâ€™s ready for file transfer.
1. Install the app: `./deploy.sh`.
    * Pass the app you wish to deplopy:
        * `./deploy.sh build/App-Template/TEMPLATE.uf2`.
        * `./deploy.sh build/App-Scheduling/SCHEDULING_DEMO.uf2`.
    * To trigger a build, include the `--build` or `-b` flag: `./deploy.sh -b`.

## Debug vs Release

You can switch between build types when you make the `cmake` call in step 5, above. A debug build is made explicit with:

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

For a release build, which among various optimisations omits UART debugging code, call:

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Follow both of these commands with the usual

```shell
cmake --build build
```
